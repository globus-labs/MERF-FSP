# MERF-FSP

### 

This repository contains code associated with image processing for the [Combustion Synthesis Research Facility](https://www.anl.gov/node/122301).

Primary novelty is in an implementation of [Difference of Gaussians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians) on GPU using PyTorch primitives
